Yosemite System Font Replacement
================================
Version 1.11

This special Input Sans font package is designed to replace the Helvetica-based system font on Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite.

## Install

Place the font files in your /Library/Fonts folder (the one inside your root directory). Log out and log back in for all changes to take effect.

## Uninstall

To uninstall, simply remove the files from the /Library/Fonts folder. Log out and in again for all changes to take effect.

## More Info

These special fonts contain metadata that allow them to masquerade as the system font family, and will not install like normal fonts. Installing them is a nondestructive process: by placing the fonts in your /Library/Fonts folder, you can override the defaults without modifying system files or configuration. Simply remove these font files and everything goes back to normal. This approach was inspired by Jens Kutílek’s Fira System Font Replacement.

These fonts have been scaled and adjusted to make them more suitable for use in Yosemite’s interface, and stem weights, letterspacing, and certain letterforms have been changed. These are beta fonts, and are not intended to be used for other purposes.
